            <p>All scenes are professionally equipped and staffed by professional sound and light people. We do
                everything we can to give participants the best, funniest and safest experience playing at the festival.
                We hope you will do your best and fire it off when the scene is yours!</p>
            <p>All acts must perform at least 20 minutes so that we do not get too big “gaps” in the program.</p>
